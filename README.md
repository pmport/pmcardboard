# PMCardboard

## At the current state in development, PMCardboard is not a complete, stable experience.

PMCardboard is a fanmade PC port of the N64 RPG Paper Mario, based on [the work of the Paper Mario Reverse Engineering Team](https://github.com/pmret/papermario).

To set up the repository, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).
